#🚀 AI vs Human Text Analysis & Prediction Dashboard

##📌 Project Overview
With the rapid growth of AI-generated content, distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated text has become increasingly important for content validation, quality assurance, and ethical AI usage.
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify text as AI-generated or human-written and presents the results through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow, including text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization, making it suitable for real-world analytical and decision-support applications.

##🎯 Objectives
* Identify linguistic patterns that differentiate AI-generated and human-written text
* Apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing and vectorization
* Build and evaluate a machine learning classification model
* Visualize predictions and insights using an interactive dashboard

##🧠 Methodology
1. Text Preprocessing
-Cleaned and normalized raw text using NLP techniques such as lowercasing and noise removal

2. Feature Engineering
-TF-IDF vectorization for textual representation
-Numerical features including word count, text length, quality score, and plagiarism score

3. Model Building & Evaluation
-Trained a Logistic Regression classifier for binary classification
-Evaluated model performance using a confusion matrix and classification metrics

4. Visualization & Insights
-Exported prediction results with engineered features
-Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard with KPI cards, pie charts, slicers, and detailed tables for exploratory analysis and stakeholder-friendly insights
